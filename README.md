# MalwareDetection
Malware Detection based on (Deep) Neural Networks 

## Background
Malware is referred to as malicious software (e.g., worms, Trojans, etc.) designed to destroy or occupy the target computer resources. Existing malware detection technologies mainly include signature detection, behaviour detection, etc and machine learning can improve the generalization ability and the accuracy of detecting malicious samples.
 
## Requirement
This project aims to devise an effective malware detection approach that can identify any abnormal files - e.g., infected virus, Trojan Horse program, mining program, DDoS Trojan, extortion virus - from the normal ones. Particularly, based on the file footprint data, one can track how a file uses a system call, thread id and the calling sequence within a thread. The problem can be formulated as a supervised learning problem, e.g., classification. To make the best use of these data, one possible way is model the data in the form of graph -- constructing a heterogeneous information network (HIN) or heterogeneous graph and then exploiting semantics between entities before embedding them into numerical vectors. The embedding can be empowered by deep graph embedding models such as GCN or GAT.  The proposed detection model should be compared against comparative approaches such as shallow learning models including decision Tree, Boost, GLM, CTree, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network and/or other advanced Deep Neural Network models.
